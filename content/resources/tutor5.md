Josh Tenenbaum and colleagues propose that our intuitions about properties like the stability of a stack of blocks, may derive from “probabilistic programs” that can simulate, with some uncertainty, the physics that governs how objects behave in space and time. Such programs can be implemented and tested using probabilistic programming languages such as the Church language.
