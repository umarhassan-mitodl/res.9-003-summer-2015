description: Some intelligent behaviors emerge from activity in brain regions specialized
  for particular functions, as shown in a visualization of the brain of Prof. Nancy
  Kanwisher created from fMRI data (top left). Researchers are converging on an understanding
  of the neural circuits underlying the early stages of object recognition, captured
  in a model proposed by Prof. Tomaso Poggio and colleagues (right). The iCub robot
  created by researchers at the Italian Institute of Technology is an open source
  platform for exploring models of intelligent systems (lower left). fMRI visualization
