description: Visualization of the results of principal components analysis applied
  to high-dimensional data capturing visual properties of handwritten digits. The
  data was reduced to three dimensions that capture most of the variation in the original
  data, roughly segregating the data into the corresponding digits, as portrayed by
  the different colors of the data points.
