Josh Tenenbaum and colleagues propose that our intuitions about properties like the stability of a stack of objects, may derive from “probabilistic programs” in our heads that can simulate, with some uncertainty, the physics that governs how objects behave in space and time. Aspects of these programs are learned from infancy, as a child interacts with the world.
